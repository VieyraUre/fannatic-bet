Weekly calculations are held from Monday (00:00 AM to Sunday (11:59 PM).</li>
<li>The limits are put into action the moment the casino bet exceeds the established parameter. This means that the result of the last bet will be taken into account for the final balance and activation of the provider limit. -In case of requiring custom limits, please contact our support.</li>
